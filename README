torrent-scrape

automatic torrent and subtitle search

This script was inspired by a friend 
who lost his mind dealing with pirate bay's popup ads.
I myself ofcourse do not participate in any of the illegal 
activities promoted by the pirate bay users and have 
gotten all the information from my friends and family.

Script search_piratebay can be used from the os terminal 
as "python search_piratebay.py <torrent name>".
For info about the keyword arguments try
"python search_piratebay.py -h".
